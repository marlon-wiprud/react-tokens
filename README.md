# react-tokens

Hi! thanks for taking the time to check out my code.

- To test this project:

  1. \$ npm i
  2. \$ npm start
  3. navigate to localhost:8080

- Home page displays all tokens

- Clicking "More info" will navigate to a new page, displaying all fields for the specified token.

- Clicking "Favorite" will add a token to the favorites list. This is available from the home screen, as well as a tokens "more info" page. Favorites list persists on page refresh. (stored in session storage)

- Click "add token" on the top nav bar to submit a form containing all fields required to post a new token to the DB.
